# C++ Ray Tracing Engine
> A simple Raytracer written in C++.

This project was built following 
1. Peter Shirley's book [Ray Tracing in one weekend][book].
2. [nicebyte][nicebyte]'s implementation of the book.

I started this project for learning C++ and Ray Tracing. 
Thanks to above two sources for helping me do so. :)

## Usage example

Arrangement of the scene is defined in the main function which is passed along with each ray to "color" function where the path of the ray is traced.

## Development setup

The project uses a math header [nicemath.h][nicemath] created by [nicebyte][nicebyte].
The project only requires a valid C++ compiler installation.
